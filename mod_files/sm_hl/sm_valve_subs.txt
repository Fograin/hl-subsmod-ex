$holdtime 7
$chained !HOLO_INTRO_PT2
!HOLO_INTRO
{
Hello and welcome to the Black Mesa Hazard Course, where you'll be trained in the use of the Hazardous Environment Suit.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_INTRO_PT2
{
I'm your holographic assistant. Let's begin by stepping into your suit! You can see it suspended up ahead of you.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_BUTTON
{
If you see one of these buttons, press it and I will appear to demonstrate certain moves.
}

$holdtime 15
!HOLO_MOVE
{
Moving around in your H.E.V. Suit can be slightly disorienting at first. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic movement, and soon it will fit you like a second skin! I will see you just around the corner!
}

$holdtime 4.5
$chained !HOLO_JUMP_PT2
!HOLO_JUMP
{
The first move we will practice in the Hazard Course is basic jumping!
}

$holdtime 6
$chained !HOLO_JUMP_PT3
!HOLO_JUMP_PT2
{
You'll attempt to get over this set of pipes, using only your run and jump commands.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_JUMP_PT3
{
It helps to get a running start. Watch me and then try it yourself!
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_DUCK
{
You will now duck under the next set of obstacles. Please note that crouching will automatically shift your suit into stealth mode, minimizing movement noise.
}

$holdtime 12
!HOLO_JDUCK
{
Now we will combine skills. You'll need to JUMP, DUCK and then JUMP again! This will prepare you for the next room, where you'll have to do both moves at the same time.
}

$holdtime 5
$chained !HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK
{
To get into these pipes, you'll have to signal your suit to make a duck jump.
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
{
You want to stand right at the mouth of the pipe and continue to press forward. Then jump up and while are you in mid air, go into a crouch. It's tricky, but you'll find it comes in handy!
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_NICEJOB
{
Nice job!
}

$holdtime 9
!HOLO_LADDER
{
Walk directly into the ladder, look up and continue moving forward. If you want to come back down, just move backward.
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_3JUMPS
{
The next 3 jumps get harder each time, but they are quite possible. Don't be surprised if you miss the last one a time or two. If you can make all 3 in a continuous run, you are doing well!
}

$holdtime 2.5
!HOLO_KEEPTRYING
{
Keep trying! You'll get it!
}

$holdtime 3
!HOLO_RUNSTART
{
It helps to have a running start!
}

$holdtime 4
!HOLO_FALLSHORT
{
If you keep falling short, you might be jumping too soon.
}

$holdtime 5
!HOLO_GREATWORK
{
Great work! Now there's one more style of jumping you need to learn.
}

$holdtime 4
$chained !HOLO_LONGJUMP_PT2
!HOLO_LONGJUMP
{
Long jumping requires its own charging module, seen here.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_LONGJUMP_PT2
{
To activate your long jump, you will have to duck and move forward and then launch into a jump. Once you are up on the platform press the button and I will demonstrate the move.
}

$holdtime 7
!HOLO_RETRY
{
Give it another try. Remember to move forward, jump and while in mid air, crouch.
}

$holdtime 5.5
!HOLO_STARTLIFT
{
Please start the lift by moving up to the button, looking at it and pressing the Use key.
}

$holdtime 7.5
$chained !HOLO_JUMPDOWN_PT2
!HOLO_JUMPDOWN
{
Now that you're up here, there's only one way down. Find the target on the floor below and do your best to hit it! 
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_JUMPDOWN_PT2
{
If you take any damage from the fall, we will administer medical care at the next station.
}

$holdtime 8.6
$chained !HOLO_MEDKIT_PT2
!HOLO_MEDKIT
{
You'll find medkits like this one through out the Black Mesa compound. To restore your health, walk up to medkit and press your Use key.
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_MEDKIT_PT2
{
Your health will recover gradually, until you are at full health or the kit is depleted. Once the light goes out, a medkit cannot be reused.
}

$holdtime 5
!HOLO_SPINBRIDGE
{
To spin that bridge, walk up to the control wheel and press the Use key.
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_FANTASTIC
{
Fantastic!
}

$holdtime 8.2
!HOLO_JUMPGAP
{
Sometimes you'll need to rely on more than just your suit to get through a tight place. Try jumping this gap on your own.
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_PUSHBOX
{
What you really need to do is push that box down into the pit. Pushing is easy! Just move forward against the box and you can push it into position.
}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_PULLBOX_PT2
!HOLO_PULLBOX
{
If you can't push the obstacle out of your way, you might try pulling it. To pull a box, move up to it and press your Use key.
}

$holdtime 7.5
!HOLO_PULLBOX_PT2
{
While holding down the Use key to keep a grip on a box, move slowly backward. The box will come along with you.
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_BREAKBOX
{
Finally, if nothing else works, you can try breaking the objects in your path. Make sure you picked up the crowbar, then simply smash your way through the debris.
}

$holdtime 3
!HOLO_FLASHLIGHT
{
Activate your suit flashlight for the next area.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_LIGHTOFF
{
Great! Remember, your flashlight drains power. So, switch it off when you don't need it!
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_TARGET
{
Welcome to the Black Mesa Target Range, where you'll receive training in firing a weapon, reloading, and firing the attached grenade launcher. Please pick up your weapon and advance to the firing station.
}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_HITALL_PT2
!HOLO_HITALL
{
You'll have to hit every target in order to complete the course. But if you miss the first time, don't worry, it will come around again.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_HITALL_PT2
{
Try to reload during pauses, rather than waiting to run out of ammunition at a critical time.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_GRENADE
{
To fire your grenade launcher, use your Alternate Fire button. Certain targets will break only when hit by grenades.
}

$holdtime 5.5
!HOLO_COMMENCING
{
Commencing sequence in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
}

!HOLO_CONGRATS
{
Congratulations! You have completed the Black Mesa Target Range. Please advance to the next area!
}

$holdtime 16
!HOLO_DROWN
{
Your H.E.V. Suit monitors blood oxygen levels, warning you when you need to find an air supply. As you swim through this course, your oxygen levels will begin to drop. At the midpoint, you will be given an opportunity to surface for air.
}

$holdtime 12
!HOLO_BREATH
{
Come up and catch your breath! You'll see the blood oxygen indicator on your suit's H.U.D. returning to its previous level. You are free to swim on to the end of the course.
}

$holdtime 9.3
$chained !HOLO_CHARGER_PT2
!HOLO_CHARGER
{
This is the charging unit for your Hazardous Environment Suit. When you're running low on power, step up to any charger and press Use key.
}

$holdtime 8.3
!HOLO_CHARGER_PT2
{
Your suit will recharge gradually, until the charge unit is depleted. Individual batteries may also be used to charge your suit.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_STEAM
{
If you pass through fire or steam, you will see a heat damage icon lighting up. Directional indicators at the center of your display show you where damage is coming from.
}

$holdtime 9
!HOLO_RADIATION
{
Proximity to radiation activates a Geiger counter and radiation display. Biohazards are also indicated with the luminous icon.
}

$holdtime 2.5
!HOLO_INJURY
{
Please advance to the next area.
}

$holdtime 5.5
$chained !HOLO_LEADGUARD_PT2
