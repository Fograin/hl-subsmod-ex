Hello and welcome to the Black Mesa Hazard Course, where you'll be trained in the use of the Hazardous Environment Suit.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_INTRO_PT2
{
I'm your holographic assistant. Let's begin by stepping into your suit! You can see it suspended up ahead of you.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_BUTTON
{
If you see one of these buttons, press it and I will appear to demonstrate certain moves.
}

$holdtime 15
!HOLO_MOVE
{
Moving around in your H.E.V. Suit can be slightly disorienting at first. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic movement, and soon it will fit you like a second skin! I will see you just around the corner!
}

$holdtime 4.5
$chained !HOLO_JUMP_PT2
!HOLO_JUMP
{
The first move we will practice in the Hazard Course is basic jumping!
}

$holdtime 6

!HOLO_JUMP_PT2
{
You'll attempt to get over this set of pipes, using only your run and jump commands.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_JUMP_PT3
{
It helps to get a running start. Watch me and then try it yourself!
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_DUCK
{
You will now duck under the next set of obstacles. Please note that crouching will automatically shift your suit into stealth mode, minimizing movement noise.
}

$holdtime 12
!HOLO_JDUCK
{
Now we will combine skills. You'll need to JUMP, DUCK and then JUMP again! This will prepare you for the next room, where you'll have to do both moves at the same time.
}

$holdtime 5
$chained !HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK
{
To get into these pipes, you'll have to signal your suit to make a duck jump.
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
{
You want to stand right at the mouth of the pipe and continue to press forward. Then jump up and while are you in mid air, go into a crouch. It's tricky, but you'll find it comes in handy!
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_NICEJOB
{
Nice job!
}

$holdtime 9
!HOLO_LADDER
{
Walk directly into the ladder, look up and continue moving forward. If you want to come back down, just move backward.
}

}

$holdtime 2.5
!HOLO_KEEPTRYING
{
Keep trying! You'll get it!
}

$holdtime 3
!HOLO_RUNSTART

}

$holdtime 4

{
Great work! Now there's one more style of jumping you need to learn.
}

$holdtime 4

{
Long jumping requires its own charging module, seen here.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_LONGJUMP_PT2

To activate your long jump, you will have to duck and move forward and then launch into a jump. Once you are up on the platform press the button and I will demonstrate the move.
}

{
Give it another try. Remember to move forward, jump and while in mid air, crouch.
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_FANTASTIC
{
Fantastic!
}

$holdtime 8.2

{
Sometimes you'll need to rely on more than just your suit to get through a tight place. Try jumping this gap on your own.
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_PUSHBOX
{
What you really need to do is push that box down into the pit. Pushing is easy! Just move forward against the box and you can push it into position.
}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_PULLBOX_PT2
!HOLO_PULLBOX
{
If you can't push the obstacle out of your way, you might try pulling it. To pull a box, move up to it and press your Use key.

Activate your suit flashlight for the next area.
}

$holdtime 6

}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_HITALL_PT2

}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_HITALL_PT2
{
Try to reload during pauses, rather than waiting to run out of ammunition at a critical time.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_GRENADE
{
To fire your grenade launcher, use your Alternate Fire button. Certain targets will break only when hit by grenades.
}

Will we ever make it out of here?

!SC_QUESTION4

Are you sure this is the right way?
}

$holdtime 2.5
!SC_QUESTION5

It can't get any worse than this.
}

$holdtime 3.5

Don't you find this all rather fascinating?

Well, I think it's rather stimulating, don't you?

It's highly probable that our luck will change, don't you agree?

Did you hear something?

Do you smell what I smell?

!SC_QUESTION12
{
Fat lot of good that Ph.D. does me now, hmm?
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_QUESTION13

Don't you think we should wait here for a while?
}

$holdtime 4.2
!SC_QUESTION14
{
Do you recall any of those emergency survival procedures?
}

$holdtime 5.5
!SC_QUESTION15

These crab creatures have a unique parasitic strategy, don't you think? 
}

$holdtime 4
!SC_QUESTION16
{
I believe this will make for a notable paper, don't you?
}

$holdtime 2.5
!SC_QUESTION17
{
Shouldn't we try to capture a specimen?
}

$holdtime 6.5
!SC_QUESTION18
{
Are you seriously suggesting that all of these beings are here to dine on us?
}

$holdtime 4
!SC_QUESTION19
{
Do you suspect some alien subterfuge behind this failure?
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_QUESTION20
{
Do you think we should appeal to the alien authorities?
}

$holdtime 5.6
!SC_QUESTION21
{
The military clean up is just a paranoid rumor, isn't it?
}

$holdtime 6
!SC_QUESTION22

The alien species can't possibly all be hostile... can they?
}

$holdtime 3

Did you understand that last announcement?
}

$holdtime 2.5

Do you smell something burning?

You have no idea what is going on, do you?

Well, do you have any idea what to do next?

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_IDLE0

I predicted all of this, you know. All of it!
}

$holdtime 3.8
!SC_IDLE1

It appears the containment system has completely failed...
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_IDLE2
{
Do you still say there is nothing to chaos theory?
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_IDLE3
{
How interesting, just look at that!
}

$holdtime 5.5
!SC_IDLE4
{
Fascinating! I never suspected such things could be!
}

$holdtime 4.5
!SC_IDLE5
{
Why, just look at those peculiar markings.
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_IDLE6
{
Who is responsible for this mess?
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_IDLE7
{
Well, there goes our grant money.
}
 
$holdtime 4.2
!SC_IDLE8
{
Wouldn't you like to get one of these blood samples under a microscope?
}
 
$holdtime 5.2
!SC_IDLE9

I suspected this could happen, but the administrator just would not listen.
}
 
$holdtime 4.2
!SC_IDLE10
{
A failure of this magnitude is extremely improbable.
}
 
$holdtime 5.2
!SC_IDLE11
{
Well, the dimensional breach is definitely transmitting organic matter.
}
 
$holdtime 4.5
!SC_IDLE12
{
I hope those people in the Lambda lab can get this under control.
}

$holdtime 4.5
!SC_PIDLE2

I wonder if I should run that test again?
}

$holdtime 3

This is all within theoretical limits.
}

$holdtime 2
!SC_PIDLE4
{
As I expected.
}

$holdtime 2
!SC_PIDLE5
{
That's odd.
}

$holdtime 3

Yes... This all looks nominal.
}

$holdtime 4

Now, where did I leave that shutdown procedure chart?

Most of these simulation results are perfectly acceptable, you know.

Any ideas on the origin of that new sample?

This analysis is going to run perfectly today, don't you think?

Aren't you a bit worried about that exponential cascade scenario we discussed?

I'm glad to see you're all right, Mr. Calhoun, but we really need another power cell if we expect to get out of here. You'll have to go back down there, find a power cell, and send it back up to us fully charged. We're all depending on you.

We've discovered a strange borderworld that was somehow involved in the process, which kept us from accurately predicting where any given teleportation event will lead back on earth.

Some of the more promising research on the matter led to a device that could be attached to strange crystalline structures we found on this borderworld.

{
The power reserves were just enough to open a field for your trip to the borderworld. If we plan on keeping the teleporter open long enough to calculate a safe exit point, and allow time for everyone to go through, someone will have to go to the lower level, and retrieve another power cell.
}
