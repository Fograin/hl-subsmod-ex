Hello and welcome to the Black Mesa Hazard Course, where you'll be trained in the use of the Hazardous Environment Suit.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_INTRO_PT2
{
I'm your holographic assistant. Let's begin by stepping into your suit! You can see it suspended up ahead of you.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_BUTTON
{
If you see one of these buttons, press it and I will appear to demonstrate certain moves.
}

$holdtime 15
!HOLO_MOVE
{
Moving around in your H.E.V. Suit can be slightly disorienting at first. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with basic movement, and soon it will fit you like a second skin! I will see you just around the corner!
}

$holdtime 4.5
$chained !HOLO_JUMP_PT2
!HOLO_JUMP
{
The first move we will practice in the Hazard Course is basic jumping!
}

$holdtime 6

!HOLO_JUMP_PT2
{
You'll attempt to get over this set of pipes, using only your run and jump commands.
}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_JUMP_PT3
{
It helps to get a running start. Watch me and then try it yourself!
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_DUCK
{
You will now duck under the next set of obstacles. Please note that crouching will automatically shift your suit into stealth mode, minimizing movement noise.
}

$holdtime 12
!HOLO_JDUCK
{
Now we will combine skills. You'll need to JUMP, DUCK and then JUMP again! This will prepare you for the next room, where you'll have to do both moves at the same time.
}

$holdtime 5
$chained !HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK
{
To get into these pipes, you'll have to signal your suit to make a duck jump.
}

$holdtime 13
!HOLO_PIPEDUCK_PT2
{
You want to stand right at the mouth of the pipe and continue to press forward. Then jump up and while are you in mid air, go into a crouch. It's tricky, but you'll find it comes in handy!
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_NICEJOB
{
Nice job!
}

$holdtime 9
!HOLO_LADDER
{
Walk directly into the ladder, look up and continue moving forward. If you want to come back down, just move backward.
}

}

$holdtime 2.5
!HOLO_KEEPTRYING
{
Keep trying! You'll get it!
}

$holdtime 3
!HOLO_RUNSTART

}

$holdtime 4

{
Great work! Now there's one more style of jumping you need to learn.
}

$holdtime 4

{
Long jumping requires its own charging module, seen here.
}

$holdtime 11
!HOLO_LONGJUMP_PT2

To activate your long jump, you will have to duck and move forward and then launch into a jump. Once you are up on the platform press the button and I will demonstrate the move.
}

{
Give it another try. Remember to move forward, jump and while in mid air, crouch.
}

$holdtime 1.5
!HOLO_FANTASTIC
{
Fantastic!
}

$holdtime 8.2

{
Sometimes you'll need to rely on more than just your suit to get through a tight place. Try jumping this gap on your own.
}

$holdtime 10
!HOLO_PUSHBOX
{
What you really need to do is push that box down into the pit. Pushing is easy! Just move forward against the box and you can push it into position.
}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_PULLBOX_PT2
!HOLO_PULLBOX
{
If you can't push the obstacle out of your way, you might try pulling it. To pull a box, move up to it and press your Use key.

Activate your suit flashlight for the next area.
}

$holdtime 6

}

$holdtime 8
$chained !HOLO_HITALL_PT2

}

$holdtime 6
!HOLO_HITALL_PT2
{
Try to reload during pauses, rather than waiting to run out of ammunition at a critical time.
}

$holdtime 8
!HOLO_GRENADE
{
To fire your grenade launcher, use your Alternate Fire button. Certain targets will break only when hit by grenades.
}

Yeah, I've got the clearance codes to the security station, but I'm not leaving until those soldiers down there have been cleared out. If you can't take 'em out, maybe you can seal 'em off. Either way, it's not safe for me to leave here.

I believe this will make for a notable paper, don't you?

Do you think we should appeal to the alien authorities?

The military clean up is just a paranoid rumor, isn't it?

All right, Gordon, your suit should keep you comfortable through all this. The specimen will be delivered to you in a few moments.
}

If you would be so good as to climb up and start the rotors, we can bring the anti-mass spectrometer to 80% and hold it there until the carrier arrives.

{
Gordon, are you not hearing me? Climb up and start the rotors, please!
}

CLIMB UP and START the rotors!

Very good... We'll take it from here.

{
I'm seeing predictable phase arrays.
}

Tell him to stand back from focal stage! That suit won't do him any good if he wanders in the beam!

Stage 2 emitters activating... Now!
}

$holdtime 11

I've just been informed that the sample is ready, Gordon. It should be coming up to you any moment now! Look to the delivery system for your specimen.
}

$holdtime 7.5
!SC_DIS7A
{
Standard insertion for a nonstandard specimen! Go ahead, Gordon. Slot the carrier into the analysis port.
}

$holdtime 5
!SC_DIS9A
{
Overhead capacitors to 105%.
}

$holdtime 9
!SC_DIS10A

Gordon, we cannot predict how long the system can operate at this level, nor how long the readings will take... Please, work as quickly as you can!
}

$holdtime 12
!SC_DIS11A
{
Uh, it's probably not a problem, probably... but I'm showing a small discrepancy in... well, no, it's well within acceptable bounds again. Sustaining sequence!
}

$holdtime 5
!SC_DIS12A
{
Nothing you need to worry about, Gordon, heh... That's it... Go ahead!
}

$holdtime 2
!SC_DIS13A
{
What is he doing in there!?
}

$holdtime 4.5
!SC_DIS14A
{
GET HIM OUT OF THERE! Shut down the equipment and someone get him out!
}

$holdtime 9
!SC_DIS15A
{
Shutting down! Attempting shutdown... It's not! It's not, it's not shutting down! IT'S NOT-
}

$holdtime 4
!SC_DIS16A
{
Gordon! Get away from the beams!
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_DIS17A
{
He waited too long! We can't contain it!
}

$holdtime 6
!SC_LOCK1A
{
I'm afraid we'll be deviating a bit from standard analysis procedures today, Gordon.
}

$holdtime 8
!SC_LOCK2A
{
Yes, but with good reason! This is a rare opportunity for us. This is the purest sample we've seen yet!
}

$holdtime 2.8
!SC_LOCK3A
{
And... potentially, the most unstable...
}

$holdtime 4.8
!SC_LOCK4A
{
Now, now, if you follow standard insertion procedures, everything will be fine!
}

$holdtime 8.2
!SC_LOCK5A
{
I don't know how you can say that. Although I will admit that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is extremely unlikely...
}

$holdtime 8.5
!SC_LOCK6A
{
Gordon doesn't need to hear all this, he's a highly trained professional! We've assured the administrator that nothing will go wrong...
}

$holdtime 5.5
!SC_LOCK7A
{
Ah... yes, you're right... Gordon, we have complete confidence in you!
}

$holdtime 3.5
!SC_LOCK8A
{
Well, go ahead. Let's let him in now!
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_CRIT1A

Quick! It's about to go critical!
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_CRIT2A
{
What the hell is going on with our equipment?
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_CRIT3A
{
It wasn't meant to do this in the first place.
}

$holdtime 5
!SC_CTRL1A
{
Ah, Gordon. Here you are! We just sent the sample down to the test chamber.
}

$holdtime 7
!SC_CTRL2A
{
We boosted the anti-mass spectrometer 105%. Bit of a gamble, but we need the extra resolution.
}

$holdtime 8
!SC_CTRL3A
{
The administrator is very concerned that we get a conclusive analysis of today's sample. I gather they went to some length to get it.
}

$holdtime 4.5
!SC_CTRL4A
{
They're waiting for you, Gordon. In the Test Chamber.
}

$holdtime 2.5
!SC_CONSOLE1A

Why didn't they listen?!
}

$holdtime 2.8
!SC_CONSOLE2A

We tried to warn them!

I never thought I'd see a resonance cascade, let alone create one...

Please, get to the surface as soon as you can, and let someone know we're stranded down here! You'll need me to activate the retinal scanners! I'm sure the rest of the science team will gladly help you!

}

$holdtime 11
!SC_LOUNGE

Gordon! If I'd known it was you, I'd have let you in! Everyone's heading for the surface, but I think they're crazy not to stay put. Someone is bound to come by and rescue us.
}

$holdtime 9.5

I just overheard a secure access transmission. Soldiers have arrived and they're coming to rescue us! Of course, I have my doubts that we'll live long enough to greet them...

Take me with you! I'm the one man who knows everything!

Is someone there? I... I can't see a thing...
}

I hope no one expects me to start up the generator. Smithers went down there and never came back.

Well, so much for the government! Their idea of "containment" is to kill everyone associated with the project! Judging from your hazard suit, I'd say you were part of what went wrong... Isn't that right?
}

$holdtime 6
$chained !SC_TRUST_PT3

Now look, if anyone can end this catastrophe, it's the science team in the Lambda complex, at the opposite end of the base!
}

$chained !SC_TRUST_PT4
!SC_TRUST_PT3

With the transit system out, I couldn't tell you how to get there, but there's an old decommissioned rail system somewhere through here, beyond the silo complex.
}

$holdtime 12
!SC_TRUST_PT4
{
If you can make it through the rocket test labs, you might be able to worm your way through the old tunnels to track down whatever's left of the Lambda team! You can trust them. You can trust all of us. Good luck!

No! NO! NO! Get it off me! Get it off! GET IF OFF!!!

They said it was hauled from the Challenger Deep, but I'm positive that beast never swam in terrestrial waters until a week ago!
}

There's a tranquilizer gun in the shark cage but I'm not sure it would work on this species. You're welcome to try.
}

$chained !SC_TRACK_PT2
!SC_TRACK
{
Gordon Freeman, it is you, isn't it? The science team has been tracking your progress with the Black Mesa security system. Unfortunately, so has the military. That suit of yours is full of tracking devices.
}

$holdtime 8.8
$chained !SC_TRACK_PT3
!SC_TRACK_PT2
{
Still, it's better than going naked in this place. It's cold in there and you'll have to hurry. It could sap your suit power in a matter of moments!
}

$holdtime 9.2
!SC_TRACK_PT3
{
If you're bent on reaching the Lambda complex, then you want to keep to the older industrial areas, where the security system is full of holes. It worked for me, so far.
}

$holdtime 3
!SC_TAU2A
{
Put that down! It's a prototype!
}

$holdtime 4
!SC_TAU4A
{
It's much too unpredictable! Don't let it overcharge!
}

$holdtime 6.5
!SC_1PSURG
{
We all have retinal scanner access. Escort us to the lobby, and we can get out of the lab.
}

$holdtime 6.5
!SC_2PSURG
{
You'll have to shut down the surgical unit first. Peters switched it on, but I'm afraid he never made it back...
}

!SC_3PSURG
{
A scientist, thank God! Get us out of here before those military drones figure out where we're hiding!
}

$holdtime 4.5

If you let us all die, Freeman, you'll never get out of here!
}

!SC_LETOUT
$chained !SC_LETOUT_PT2
{
Well... I'll let you out, but I'm warning you, it's hell out there! It's completely under military control! You'll have to sneak and fight your way from one end to the other, and I don't expect you'll meet many of our peers along the way...
}

$holdtime 12
!SC_LETOUT_PT2
{
But if you do survive and somehow make it across the base, you'll end up at the Lambda complex, where the rest of the science team has taken shelter. I wouldn't venture there myself, but I will let them know that you are coming!
}

$holdtime 10.2
$chained !SC_BOOBIE_PT2
!SC_BOOBIE
{
You're heading for the Lambda complex, aren't you? I was heading there myself until I wound up here and, well, simply lost my nerve. Take one look through that door and you'll see what I mean!
}

$holdtime 7.5

I'm just going to wait out the catastrophe in here. If you intend to go on, then I beg of you, proceed with extreme caution!

$chained !SC_STRAWS_PT2
!SC_STRAWS
{
I apologize, Mr. Freeman, but I couldn't risk opening that door until I was sure you'd scoured the area! This is the last entrance to the Lambda Complex, every other has been sealed off to contain the invasion!
}

$holdtime 7.6
$chained !SC_STRAWS_PT3
!SC_STRAWS_PT2

When we realized that you might actually make it here, we drew straws to see who should stay behind to let you through. Obviously, I drew the short one...
}

My colleagues are waiting at the tip of the Lambda reactor! Waiting for you, I mean...
}

$holdtime 7.5
$chained !SC_STRAWS_PT5

The reactor is shut down right now, but you can activate it on your way up! You'll have to flood the core anyway to get into the teleportation labs. 
}

$holdtime 7

You're not authorized to know about those... but I can see you already know a great deal more than any one man is supposed to.
}

Were you in weapons research, too? I built the Gluon Gun, but I just can't bring myself to use it on a living creature. You don't look as if you have any trouble killing things...
}

$holdtime 9.5
!SC_FLOOD
{
Freeman, isn't it? You'll need to activate both pumps to flood the reactor, and then that access pipe down there will take you to the core. Time is short!
}

$holdtime 9

{
Don't linger, Mr. Freeman! You've turned on the pumps! Now take the access pipe, flood the core, and get on up to the labs without delay!

This is the supply depot for our first survey team. Quite a few handsome specimens were collected from the border-world and brought back this way... Umm, before the survey members started being collected themselves, that is...
}

$holdtime 13.5
!SC_SURVEY3A_PT2
{
We suspect there is an immense portal over there, created by the intense concentration of a single powerful being. You will know it when you see it... I hate to say this, Gordon... but you must kill it, if you can.
}

$holdtime 7.5
!SC_SURVEY5A

Of course, you owe us nothing, Mr. Freeman! But you've come this far. You know as much about these creatures as anyone!
}

Yes... so... If you're willing, my colleague is waiting for you at the main portal controls. He will open the gates for you, Mr. Freeman. Do hurry!
}

!SC_LJUMP
{
This, Mr. Freeman, is a long-jump module! Created expressly for navigation in the world beyond. I certainly hope you received long-jump training, because once you're in XEN you will need it! I would advise you to practice before crossing over.
}

Hello, Freeman! I'm up here! Practice your long-jump if you must, but hurry up!
}

$holdtime 13.5
!SC_PORTAL
{
All right, I can open the portal now. The process is complicated, and once it's begun I must not be interrupted or I will have to start all over again! Don't enter the beam until I give the okay. Understood? I will begin!
}
