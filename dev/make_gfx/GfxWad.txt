Wavelength Gfx.wad Compiler v1.0
================================
A Half-Life gfx.wad compiler. It allows editing of the .bmp files
in the gfx.wad, which are: backtile.bmp, conchars.bmp, creditsfont.bmp,
lambda.bmp, lambda32.bmp, lambda64.bmp and paused.bmp. These files are 
included in this zip. Simply edit these images in a paint program, then 
compile them with Gfx.wad Compiler.

I've created conchars.txt and creditsfont.txt, which are coordinate 
scripts for the two font files: conchars.bmp and creditsfont.bmp. It
describes the script format to follow that allows you to change fonts. 
It's a rigid format so only change the numbers. Simply change the .bmp, 
then edit the .txt.

For more information about editing the gfx.wad see this article:

This program has been tested in Win95, Win98 and NT4, and will
bring up message boxes for all known errors. It supports Color
Modes over 256 colors, and Small and Large Font Settings. If you
come across a bug, send in a detailed description to me.
